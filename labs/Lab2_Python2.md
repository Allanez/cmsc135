#Laboratory Exercise 2 - Python OOP

In the previous exercise, you used some of the basic programming constructs in Python in writing solutions to the programming problems I have given you. This exercise will require you to learn some of the basic OOP constructs in Python in order write your solutions for the problem provided below:


###Problem 1 Banking in Python

Write a class called `SavingsAccount` that has the following properties and behaviours (Note that the (-,+) before an identifier denotes the visibility of the property or method):

- Properties 
  - `+balance`, denotes the remaining balance of a bank account object.
  - `-interest`, denotes the interest rate associated to a bank account object.
- Behaviours
  - `+deposit(amount)`, lams na..
  - `+withdraw(amount)`, adi gyap...
  - `+add_interest()`, just compute the new balance using the following formula `balance = balance + balance * interest`
