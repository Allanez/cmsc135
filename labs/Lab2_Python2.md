#Laboratory Exercise 2 - Python OOP

In the previous exercise, you used some of the basic programming constructs in Python in writing solutions to the programming problems I have given you. This exercise will require you to learn some of the basic OOP constructs in Python in order write your solutions for the problem provided below:


###Problem 1 Banking in Python
